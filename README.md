# weather-dashboard 
This project required me to use two different server side API'S, as well as use CSS and Javascript in order to build a functionning weather app,
some features of the weather dashboard are included but not limited to getting your current and next five day(s) forecast. 
If I had more time I'd like to work on my coding logic for displaying the user's recent search's and also getting their data to save to local storage.
